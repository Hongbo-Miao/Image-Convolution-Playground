# Image Convolution Playground

## What are convolutions?

Convolution is the process of multiplying an n-dimensional matrix of values against some other data, such as audio (1D), an image (2D), or video (3D). This allows for a wide range of different operations to be applied to the data.

## Image Convolutions

This interactive demo allows you to see how different convolution operations applied to images can be used to create effects such as blurring, sharpening, and edge detection.
