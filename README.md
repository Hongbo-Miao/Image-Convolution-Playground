# Image Convolution Playground

## What are convolutional filters?

Convolutional filtering is the process of multiplying an n-dimensional matrix (kernel) of values against some other data, such as audio (1D), an image (2D), or video (3D). This allows for a wide range of different operations to be applied to the data.

## Image Convolutions

This interactive demo allows you to see how different convolution operations applied to images can be used to create effects such as blurring, sharpening, and edge detection.

Check out [this awesome demo](http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/) by [Victor Powell](https://twitter.com/vicapow) to learn more about applying convolutions to images.
